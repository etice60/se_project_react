## About the Project:

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Features:

- Header:
  - Current location
  - City
- Temperature set to filter cards
- Add new garment modal create with open and close features
- Image modal is open and closed when clicked
- Calls to external weather API when a user visits the site
- Responses are parsed and current temperature and city will be saved as a React state
- Set of clothing cards generated from hard-coded array of data

## Figma Design

The Figma design was supplied by TripleTen and used to map out the UI design for this single page application. If you click on the link below, you will see that this design includes detailed views of each component used within the react application. The images and logos used were included in the Figma design. The second link includes detailed information for building the different screen-size applications.
