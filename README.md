About the Project:
The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

Features:

- Header:
  - Cuurent location
  - City
- Temperature set to filter cards
- Add new garment modal create with open and close features
- Image modal is open and closed when clicked
- Calls to external weather API when a user visits the site
- Responses are parsed and current temperature and city will be saved as a React state
- Set of clothing cards generated from hard-coded array of data
